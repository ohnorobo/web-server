Design

main:
    deals with socket details, sends connections to individual sockets

serve_request:
    collects all the data for the packet from various sources
        tried to be very modular about these sources-
        almost everything here calls outside functions

    pulls the full request
    parses important data (request type and filename)
        we don't do any further parsing/error checking in the request, although it should
    gets the mime type for the file
    gets the data of the file

    sends all this info to send_packet
    

send_packet:
    takes in all the data needed for the packet, and sends a finished packet to the client
    this function uses helper functions for each line of the packet
    to try and keep the string parsing horror to a minimum
